Initially it's a * and ** and where to use it in Python
For example in an example as 5 ** 3
Here is the exponential lifting power ^
But in the comparison you asked
One of them is a 'tuple' and the second is 'dictionary'

Note that only these names do not have to be named  [args, argv, argc, ** kwargs, or other]

It can be called by any name but just pay attention to the tags [*, **]
The following is example Code that illustrates the best of words

'''
def pica(*you):
    assert you ,"say? i'm sorry :plz see your input"
    for ag in you:  
        print(ag) 
        
    print('Done.. But see the type *argc or you :{} \n'.format(type(you)))
    
pica('Why GAN' ,'is' ,'integrated into', 'Chatbot models')


##----------whay assert ? but about ''try and except''? 


def mopica(**me):
    assert me ,"say? again! i'm sorry :plz see your input"
    for n in me.items():
        print('{} :{}'.format(n[0] ,n[1])) 

    print('done.. but see the type **argc or me:{} \n'.format(type(me)))
    
mopica(GAN ='Is a wonderful neural network', \
       Why ='It creates flexibility in performance', \
       How='Non-adherence to the text of training data is to create new dialogues')

#pica()
mopica()

#assert? Its is simple.. I like that 


#What are the most important concepts or tools to build a great online search engine,
#recommendation system, and human-like chatbot?

'''
I've queried about my experience with the above search engines
But for Chatbut
The first thing is to work on a powerful fact engine that is similar to the work of expert systems
But it will not work alone, we will integrate the first part with machine learning algorithms or deep neural networks. This is to receive initial training data ..
Use flexible data processing tools and not rely on NLTK only
Try integrating lstm & cnn & rnn to take advantage of them
Some phrases cannot be analyzed through lstm
But you need a powerful extractor features like CNN
Some of the questions need to be answered from reality for this part of expert systems is appropriate
We can build mechanisms to process images sent by the speaker during chat
For example, a picture with text recognized by Chatbut and is based on what is inside
Or identify objects through one of the detection networks based on rcnn such as faster r-cnn or other networks like retinanet or yolo
And integrating the knowledge acquired from images into dialogue ...
Another thing is to integrate GAN into a chat system
Here, the program can generate a new and different dialogue with humans as if it were a real person.
Another thing is to make the system capable of learning through induction
I mean self-directed or progressive training by us.
Other things cannot be mentioned.
But how do we integrate all this into one building
Here is the dilemma How can we make the most of all these ??
Frankly, there is nothing impossible
It's a lot of work. Just start now and try
I will check the impossible
